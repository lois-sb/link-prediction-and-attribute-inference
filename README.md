# link-prediction-and-attribute-inference
some paper's thinking and practice in link prediction,better joint Inference for User Links and Attributes
I read some paper about link prediction combined with attribute inference,such as 
"Bi-directional Joint Inference for User Links and Attributes on Large Social Graphs" ,
"Attribute Inference Attacks in Online Social Networks".
I'm studying their algorithm and thinking how to code.
